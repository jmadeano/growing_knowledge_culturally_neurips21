Survival! Survive roughly 30 seconds while keeping at least one green box alive!

Color code:
Blue: You
Green: Good
Yellow: Enemy/Death
Purple: Targets

Strategy:
Controlling the blue box your goal is to keep as many green boxes as possible! The boxes move sporadically! Green boxes will turn purple if touched by the yellow. You must revert purple boxes by shooting them with the space bar! AVOID YELLOW BY ALL COSTS. Stay alive long enough and you will win! 
Control the BLUE box with arrow keys. Touching the YELLOW box will cost a life. The YELLOW box turns GREEN boxes to PURPLE when it touches them. All GREEN boxes turning PURPLE will also cost a life. Use the Space Bar to ""shoot"" a BROWN box from the BLUE box, in the last direction the BLUE box moved. Touch PURPLE boxes with the BROWN box to turn them back to GREEN.

Move around the level, avoiding the YELLOW box and changing purple boxes back to GREEN boxes for ~30 seconds to complete each level.

Purple squares occur when yellow square touch green squares. To win, you can turn the purple squares back to green by pressing spacebar, which temporarily creates a brown square in the last direction you moved which will turn any purple squares that touch it green. You win by surviving for a set amount of time given. A safe strategy is to turn a square green on one side of the map and while the yellow square slowly moves towards it, run to the other side and turn all the purple squares green.

Brown squares will dissappear after you move, so be careful where you place them.

It is not worthwhile trying to protect all the squares, as it does not seem to yield more points.  Picking a corner or side of the map where you can defend a set few squares to keep yourself alive is easier.

In order to get through a barrier, you must collect ALL WHITE BOXES! WHITE BOXES are scattered around the level! One white box = bypass one barrier!

Green: Good
Yellow: Enemy/Death
Purple: Targets

Strategy:
Controlling the blue box your goal is to keep as many green boxes as possible! The boxes move sporadically! Green boxes will turn purple if touched by the yellow. You must revert purple boxes by shooting them with the space bar! AVOID YELLOW BY ALL COSTS. Stay alive long enough and you will win! 
Control the BLUE box with arrow keys. Touching the YELLOW box will cost a life. The YELLOW box turns GREEN boxes to PURPLE when it touches them. All GREEN boxes turning PURPLE will also cost a life. Use the Space Bar to ""shoot"" a BROWN box from the BLUE box, in the last direction the BLUE box moved. Touch PURPLE boxes with the BROWN box to turn them back to GREEN.

Move around the level, avoiding the YELLOW box and changing purple boxes back to GREEN boxes for ~30 seconds to complete each level. It's very easy just don't touch YELLOW box!As long as there is at least one green left you will win so dont panic when they start changing.",475,"

To win, you can turn the purple squares back to green by pressing spacebar, which temporarily creates a brown square in the last direction you moved which will turn any purple squares that touch it green. You win by surviving for a set amount of time given.

Brown squares will dissappear after you move, so be careful where you place them.

It is not worthwhile trying to protect all the squares, as it does not seem to yield more points.  Picking a corner or side of the map where you can defend a set few squares to keep yourself alive is easier.

Red: Ignore
Brown: Destroys grew boxes

The yellow is deadly so avoid but let it eat every box! Eventually once everything is destroyed the level should be completed!

To win, you can turn the purple squares back to green by pressing spacebar, which temporarily creates a brown square in the last direction you moved which will turn any purple squares that touch it green. You win by surviving for a set amount of time given. A safe strategy is to turn a square green on one side of the map and while the yellow square slowly moves towards it, run to the other side and turn all the purple squares green.

Brown squares will disappear after you move, so be careful where you place them.

It is not worthwhile trying to protect all the squares, as it does not seem to yield more points.  Picking a corner or side of the map where you can defend a set few squares to keep yourself alive is easier.

All squares can collide with each other, which means you are often able to turn two squares back to green at once with a single brown square.

In order to pass green blocks without dying you must collect another colour to cancel out the green blocks you pass. Squares other than green will be stored in a bar on your blue square, acting like a 1-time shield from green squares. You may store multiple squares in your bar but only if they are the same colour, squares of other colours will simply disappear.

Shields do not carry over between levels, so don't waste time gathering any more than what you need to complete the level.

It is worth counting out how many shields you need to beat the level prior to starting.  You may need to visit several locations in a specific order to end up with the correct amount of shields needed to reach the yellow square. Plan it out before starting.

Controlling the dark blue box: Create yellow squares that eat up the map!

Color Bank:
Dark Blue: You
Grey Walls: Boxes that need to be destroyed
Yellow: Death boxes that destroy but will also kill you! 
Light blue: Death boxes/avoid
Red: Ignore
Brown: Destroys grew boxes
Blue: Shoot to create yellow

Strategy:
Spacebar allows you to create Brown boxes! First, create a path to the regular blue box! Use spacebar to destroy any grew boxes in your path! Then shoot the blue box and it will create a yellow! The yellow is deadly so avoid but let it eat every box! Eventually once everything is destroyed the level should be completed! 


You control the DARK BLUE box. Pressing space bar will shoot a BROWN square in front of you in the direction you previous moved. This BROWN square will consume the GREY/BLUE walls. Moving into a LIGHT BLUE square will kill you. Shooting a BROWN square at the BLUE squares will cause it to turn into a YELLOW square that slowly consumes all squares on the map. Avoid making contact with the YELLOW squares after triggered. Once YELLOW square is triggered it will seek out the nearest wall so don't be in its path. Red squares seem to be safe to ignore and shouldn't kill you.

To win, you can turn the purple squares back to green by pressing spacebar, which temporarily creates a brown square in the last direction you moved which will turn any purple squares that touch it green. You win by surviving for a set amount of time given. A safe strategy is to turn a square green on one side of the map and while the yellow square slowly moves towards it, run to the other side and turn all the purple squares green.

Brown squares will dissappear after you move, so be careful where you place them.

Move the DARK BLUE box with ARROW KEYS! The levels involve strategy! The goal is to bring the DARK BLUE box to the yellow box! But, levels have barriers! BARRIERS ARE MARKED AS GREEN BOXES!

In order to get through a barrier, you must collect ALL WHITE BOXES! WHITE BOXES are scattered around the level! One white box = bypass one barrier! 

DO NOT touch a GREEN box without collecting enough WHITE! Sometimes, you'll have to take another route to gather enough WHITE boxes to reach the YELLOW one. Plan out the white boxes before making your way to the final yellow box. No time limit, and no extra points for solving the level quickly. So, plan it out and be strategic. Good luck!

Survival! Survive roughly 30 seconds while keeping at least one green box alive!

Color code:
Blue: You
Green: Good
Yellow: Enemy/Death
Purple: Targets

Strategy:
Controlling the blue box your goal is to keep as many green boxes as possible! The boxes move sporadically! Green boxes will turn purple if touched by the yellow. You must revert purple boxes by shooting them with the space bar! AVOID YELLOW BY ALL COSTS. Stay alive long enough and you will win! 
Control the BLUE box with arrow keys. Touching the YELLOW box will cost a life. The YELLOW box turns GREEN boxes to PURPLE when it touches them. All GREEN boxes turning PURPLE will also cost a life. Use the Space Bar to ""shoot"" a BROWN box from the BLUE box, in the last direction the BLUE box moved. Touch PURPLE boxes with the BROWN box to turn them back to GREEN.

Move around the level, avoiding the YELLOW box and changing purple boxes back to GREEN boxes for ~30 seconds to complete each level.
