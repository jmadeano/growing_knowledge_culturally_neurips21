You must move your avatar (blue) over a green box to turn it yellow again. If all of the boxes turn green at once you will lose a life. Keep moving quickly to turn the boxes yellow again once they are turned green. Once all the moving boxes have disappeared and you have turned all your boxes yellow again the level will end.

In later levels brown moving boxes also appear. I think it can kill you if you touch one, but I'm not sure. You need to touch the stationary red boxes at the top of the level to turn them blue. Turning a box blue makes brown boxes flock to it. When a brown box enters a blue square it will disappear, but the square will turn red again. You need to turn it blue by touching it so another brown box can go there and disappear. You need to get all the brown boxes to disappear AND you need to keep all of your yellow boxes from turning green all at the same time. Focus on defending the yellow boxes first.

In later levels there are light blue boxes which are barriers you can't pass. You will encounter new colors of boxes and it seems that you ONLY need to gather the boldest colored (most red) boxes to win a level, so to end the level quickly you can ignore all other colors and go for the boldest color boxes you see. Here is a hierarchy of BOLDEST to least bold colors, so gathering the color furthest left on this list will end the level.

Red, Orange, pink, green. 

I'm not sure if you get more points for ending the level faster, or for gathering as many boxes as you can. Please pay attention to this and see what happens. You will do well. Go for red first!",36,Go for red first!,9,False

You may store multiple squares in your bar but only if they are the same colour, squares of other colours will simply disappear.

Shields do not carry over between levels, so don't waste time gathering any more than what you need to complete the level.

It is worth counting out how many shields you need to beat the level prior to starting.  You may need to visit several locations in a specific order to end up with the correct amount of shields needed to reach the yellow square. Plan it out before starting.

Orange squares will go for yellow squares while brown squares will go for red squares. You cannot die. Pressing spacebar will shoot a red square that destroys brown and orange squares. Red or yellow squares that have changed colours can be reverted by touching them. A good and easy strategy to win is to shoot a line of squares quickly perpendicular to the path of the orange and brown squares, they cannot move fast enough to cross it creating a line barrier. 

Following the last tip is your best bet. You shoot in the direction that you last moved. Move to the middle left side of the map and press right and then repeatedly tap space bar as fast as you can.
