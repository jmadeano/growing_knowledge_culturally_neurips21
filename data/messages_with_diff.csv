Controlling the blue box your goal is to keep as many green boxes as possible! The boxes move sporadically! Green boxes will turn purple if touched by the yellow. You must revert purple boxes by shooting them with the space bar! AVOID YELLOW BY ALL COSTS. Stay alive long enough and you will win! 
Control the BLUE box with arrow keys. Touching the YELLOW box will cost a life. The YELLOW box turns GREEN boxes to PURPLE when it touches them. All GREEN boxes turning PURPLE will also cost a life.

Move around the level, avoiding the YELLOW box and changing purple boxes back to GREEN boxes for ~30 seconds to complete each level. It's very easy just don't touch YELLOW box!As long as there is at least one green left you will win so dont panic when they start changing. ",0,r1cnvyIxO,7,"
